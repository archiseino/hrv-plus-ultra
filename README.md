## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) on Skin Surface Analisis

Using sample dataset from [UBFC-Phys](https://sites.google.com/view/ybenezeth/ubfc-phys)

The ground truth has the 11520 samples value over the course of 3 min (60 \* 3) video. This leaves us with the sampling rate of:

$$
\text{Sampling rate} = \frac{11520}{180} = 64 \text{ Hz}
$$

For the video itself, the frame rate of the video is around **35.14 Hz** around the entire 3 min video (180 seconds)
