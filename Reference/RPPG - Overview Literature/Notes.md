Mostly on the HRV, but on one huge signal, the articles not mentioning enough about the datasets length itself.

All articles are using ML, ML and focus on the acuracy of the Model itself rather than the performance of the HRV feature be done, I can assume it based on the Traditional HRV where it uses the FFT and integrate the area using welch or lomb perpendiogram.
